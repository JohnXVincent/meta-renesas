+* Renesas RZ/G2L Clock Pulse Generator (CPG)
+
+The CPG generates core clocks for the RZ/G2L SoCs. It includes the PLL, variable
+CPU and GPU clocks, and several fixed ratio dividers.
+The CPG also provides a Clock Domain for SoC devices, in combination with the
+CPG Module Stop (MSTP) Clocks.
+
+Required Properties:
+
+  - compatible: Must be one of
+    - "renesas,r9a07g044l-cpg" for the r9a07g044l CPG
+  - reg: Base address and length of the memory resource used by the CPG
+  - clocks: References to possible external input clocks,
+	one entry for each entry in clock-names
+  - clock-names: References to possible input clock names. Valid list as below:
+	"xinclk" (r9a07g044l)
+  - #clock-cells: Must be 2
+
+Examples
+--------
+
+  - CPG device node:
+
+	cpg: clock-controller@11010000 {
+		compatible = "renesas,r9a07g044l-cpg";
+		reg = <0  0x11010000 0 0x10000>;
+		clocks = <&xinclk>;
+		clock-names = "xinclk";
+		#clock-cells = <2>;
+	};
+
+
+  - CPG/MSTP Clock Domain member device node:
+
+	gic: interrupt-controller@11900000 {
+		compatible = "arm,gic-v3";
+		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
+		#address-cells = <0>;
+		interrupt-controller;
+		reg = <0x0 0x11900000 0 0x20000>,
+		<0x0 0x11960000 0 0x20000>;
+		clocks = <&cpg CPG_MOD R9A07G044L_CLK_GIC600>;
+		clock-names = "gic6000";
+		interrupts = <GIC_PPI 25
+			(GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(2) | IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW)>;
+	};
