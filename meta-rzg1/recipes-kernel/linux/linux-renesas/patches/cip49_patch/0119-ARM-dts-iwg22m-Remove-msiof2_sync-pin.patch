Subject: [PATCH 119/476] ARM: dts: iwg22m: Remove msiof2_sync pin

msiof2_sync is shared with CAN.
Remove it to prevent conflict with CAN.
With current testing (write/read), msiof2 still work OK without
msiof2_sync (so msiof2_ss2 will be use as chip select signal).

Futher testing/investigating may be needed.
