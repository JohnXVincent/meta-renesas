Subject: [PATCH 347/441] Revert "drm: set FMODE_UNSIGNED_OFFSET for drm files"

This reverts commit 12958d0ffa66 ("drm: set FMODE_UNSIGNED_OFFSET
for drm files")

Starting to revert 3 commits:
 commit bd2f9ce5bacb ("mmap: introduce sane default mmap limits")
 commit 6ea1dc96a03a ("mmap: relax file size limit for regular files")
 commit 12958d0ffa66 ("drm: set FMODE_UNSIGNED_OFFSET for drm files")

These commits make the new mmap() limitation for regular files. But the
platforms with 512MB RAM had problem with mapping regular files and
device drivers/kernel modules.

We have met issue "Unable to allocate required memory" with GPU maybe
due to big physical address space required.

Revert these commits can fix our issues but need further investigation
on other platforms.
