Subject: [PATCH 243/441] serial: sh-sci: Fix kernel panic after closing driver

	Commit: <a6b0756821cd4a8b03876c1b3485f79324edab6b>
	From: 	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/horms/renesas-backport.git

	The rx_timer which has been set up is not deleted when driver is closed.
	A timer is set up with a corresponding callback function when DMA
	transfer is started.  After closing SCIF driver, opens it again, IRQs
	are enabled.  At this time, time out happens and callback function,
	rx_timer_fn() is executed.
