Subject: [PATCH 188/504] v4l: vsp1: Change VSP1 LIF linebuffer FIFO

refer to https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/6013141/

Change to VSPD hardware recommended value.
Purpose is highest pixel clock without underruns.
In the default R-Car Linux BSP config this value is
wrong and therefore there are many underruns.

Here are the original settings:
HBTH = 1300 (VSPD stops when 1300 pixels are buffered)
LBTH = 200 (VSPD resumes when buffer level has decreased
            below 200 pixels)

The display underruns can be eliminated
by applying the following settings:
HBTH = 1504
LBTH = 1248
