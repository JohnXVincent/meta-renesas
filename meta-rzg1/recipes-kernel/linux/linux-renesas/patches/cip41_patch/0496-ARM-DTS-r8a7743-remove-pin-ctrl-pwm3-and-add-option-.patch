Subject: [PATCH 496/557] ARM: DTS: r8a7743: remove pin-ctrl pwm3 and add
 option for backlight for tpu

During changing mode for backlight from pwm3 to tpu.
Testcase of PWM for backlight has some conflict so don't run this test.
Now it's available and found that tpu need request pin-ctrl same as pwm3.
